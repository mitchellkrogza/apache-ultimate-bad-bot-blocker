	# Here is an example of how one supposed bad word can cause your whole site to go down.
	# An issue was logged where the users own domain name was specialisteparquet.com
	# Because this list contained the word "cialis" it was detected within his domain name causing 
	# his entire site to go down and not server any assets.
	# That one entry would even cause any site containing a word like "specialist" anywhere in any
	# of their sites pages to cause them to be blocked and whitelisting your own domain name in the
	# whitelist-domains.conf file will not even bypass this, SO BE CAREFUL PLEASE
