# Cyveillance / Qwest Communications / PSINET
# *******************************************
# I am extensively researching this subject - appears to be US government involved
# and also appears to be used by all sorts of law enforcement agencies. For one they
# do not obey robots.txt and continually disguise their User-Agent strings. Time will
# tell if this is all correct or not.
# For now see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyveillance

# IMPORTANT UPDATE ON Cyveillance / Qwest Communications !!!
# **********************************************************
# I have done a lot of research on Cyveillance now and through monitoring my logs I know
# for sure what companies are using them and what they are actually looking for.
# My research has led me to understand that Cyveillance services are used by hundreds
# of companies to help them dicsover theft of copyrighted materials like images, movies
# music and other materials. I personally believe a lot of block lists who originally recommended
# blocking Cyveillance have done so to protect their torrent or p2p sites from being scanned.
# I personally have now unblocked them as image theft is a big problem of mine but if you
# do want to block Cyveillance you can simply modify the entries in the block below from "0" to "1"
# Getty Images is one such company who appears to use Cyveillance to help monitor for copyright theft.

# If you really do want to block them change all the 0's below to 1.
# Use this section at YOUR OWN RISK, you may block some legitimate networks but after many hours of
# Research this is now the completely updated list of all IP ranges IPV4 and IPV6 owned Qwest Communications
# PSINET and Cyveillance

# IMPORTANT NOTE: If you really want to keeps bot and things out of certain parts of your web site
# Rather implement a comlex Google Re-Captcha to reach sections of your sites and for people to be able
# to access download links. Google Re-Captcha with images is too complex for any bot.

# Only uncomment the lines below if you want to block these ranges otherwise rather just leave it as is.

# BERKELEY SCANNER
# ****************
# The Berkeley University has a scanner testing all over the web sending a complex
# payload an expecting a reply from servers who are infected or who just respond to such
# a payload. The payload looks similar to this
# "$\xC9\xE1\xDC\x9B+\x8F\x1C\xE71\x99\xA8\xDB6\x1E#\xBB\x19#Hx\xA7\xFD\x0F9-"
# and is sometime VERY long. You may have noticed this in your logs.
# I support research projects and all my servers respond with an error to this type of
# string so I do not block them but if you want to block just uncomment the following line
# or email them asking them not to scan your server. They do respond.
# Visit http://169.229.3.91/ for more info

# If you really do want to block them uncomment the line below.
