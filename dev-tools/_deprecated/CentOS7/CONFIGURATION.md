# CONFIGURATION OF THE APACHE BAD BOT BLOCKER:

## FOR CENTOS 7 and APACHE 2.4.6 ONLY

## Step 1:

**CREATE THE custom.d folder needed for Apache on CENTOS 7**

**You must create this folder.**

Open Terminal

`su`

`mkdir /etc/httpd/custom.d`

## Step 2:

**COPY THE GLOBALBLACKLIST.CONF FILE FROM THE REPO**

Copy the contents of **globalblacklist.conf** into your /etc/httpd/custom.d folder. 

`cd /etc/httpd/custom.d`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -O globalblacklist.conf`

## Step 3:

**WHITELIST ALL YOUR OWN DOMAIN NAMES AND IP ADDRESSES**

Whitelist all your own domain names and IP addresses. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you do not have to keep reinserting your whitelisted domains and IP addresses every time you update.

`cd /etc/httpd/custom.d`

- copy the whitelist-ips.conf file into that folder

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/whitelist-ips.conf -O whitelist-ips.conf`


- copy the whitelist-domains.conf file into the same folder

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/whitelist-domains.conf -O whitelist-domains.conf`

Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit both whitelist-ips.conf and whitelist-domains.conf to include all your own domain names and IP addresses that you want to specifically whitelist from the blocker script. 

When pulling any future updates now you can simply pull the latest globalblacklist.conf file and it will automatically include your whitelisted domains and IP addresses. No more remembering having to do this yourself.

## Step 4:

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BLACKLIST INCLUDE FILE FOR IP ADDRESS AND IP RANGE BLOCKING**

Blacklist any IP addresses or Ranges you wish to keep out of your servers. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you have full control over what IP addresses and IP Ranges and blocked from your Apache Server.

`cd /etc/apache2/custom.d`

- copy the blacklist-ips.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/blacklist-ips.conf -O blacklist-ips.conf`


Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit the blacklist-ips.conf file as you like. 

When pulling any future updates now your custom IP blacklist will not be overwritten.

## Step 5:

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BAD REFERRER WORDS INCLUDE FILE FOR CUSTOMIZED SCANNING OF BAD WORDS**

Scan for any bad referrer words you wish to keep out of your servers. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you have full control over what IP addresses and IP Ranges and blocked from your Apache Server.

`cd /etc/apache2/custom.d`

- copy the bad-referrer-words.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/bad-referrer-words.conf -O bad-referrer-words.conf`


Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit the bad-referrer-words.conf file as you like. 

When pulling any future updates now your custom bad referrer words list will not be overwritten.

## Step 6:

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BLACKLIST USER-AGENTS INCLUDE FILE FOR CUSTOMIZED BLOCKING OF USER AGENTS**

Allows you to add your own custom list of user agents with this new include file.

`cd /etc/apache2/custom.d`

- copy the blacklist-user-agents.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf -O blacklist-user-agents.conf`

## Step 7:

**INCLUDE THE GLOBALBLACKLIST.CONF FILE INTO A VIRTUALHOST**

 Include the globalblacklist.conf file within a `<Directory>` block just after your opening Options statements and before the rest of your host config example below. 
 
 On CentOS to do this, open your httpd.conf file
 
 `nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`
 
 At the very bottom where you configure your Virtualhosts you will configure one like this example.
 You will need to do this for each Virtualhost you have set up.
 ** VERY IMPORTANT: The Include Statement MUST be located within a `<Directory></Directory>` Block**
 
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@wherever.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/mywebsite.com
    ServerName mywebsite.com
    ErrorLog logs/mywebsite.com-error_log
    CustomLog logs/mywebsite.com-access_log common
    <Directory "/var/www/html/mywebsite.com">
    Include /etc/httpd/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

## Step 8:

**RELOAD YOUR APACHE CONFIGURATION**

`service httpd reload`

If you get no errors you followed my instructions properly.

The blocker is now active and working so now you can run some simple tests from another linux machine to make sure it's working.

## Step 9:

*TESTING**

Run the following commands one by one from a terminal on another linux machine against your own domain name. 
**substitute yourdomain.com in the examples below with your REAL domain name**

`curl -A "googlebot" http://yourdomain.com`

Should respond with 200 OK

`curl -A "80legs" http://yourdomain.com`

`curl -A "masscan" http://yourdomain.com`

Should respond with 403 Forbidden

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://100dollars-seo.com`

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://zyzzcentral.ru`

Should respond with 403 Forbidden

The Apache Ultimate Bot Blocker is now WORKING and PROTECTING your web sites !!!

## Step 10:

**UPDATING THE APACHE BAD BOT BLOCKER** is now easy thanks to the automatic includes for whitelisting your own domain names.

Updating to the latest version is now as simple as:

`cd /etc/httpd/custom.d`

`su`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/CentOS7/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -O globalblacklist.conf`

`service httpd reload` 

And you will be up to date with all your whitelisted domains included automatically for you now.
