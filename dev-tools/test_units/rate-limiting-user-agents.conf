# Add One Entry Per Line - List all the extra bad User-Agents you want to permanently block or whitelist.

# This is for User-Agents that are not included in the main list of the bot blocker
# This file must exist on your system or Nginx will fail a reload due to a missing file
# This allows you finer control of keeping certain bots blocked and automatic updates will
# Never be able to remove this custom list of yours 

# Please note this include file loads first before any of the already whitelisted User-Agents
# in the bad bot blocker. By loading first in line it over-rides anything below it so for instance
# if you want to block Baidu, Google or Bing for any reason you add them to this file which loads
# first and takes precedence over anything below it. This now allows even finer control over the 
# bad bot blocker. Enjoy !!!

# Even though this file is called blacklist-user-agents, as mentioned it can also be used to whitelist user agents
# By adding them below and setting the 3; to 0; this will permanently whitelist the User-Agent.

# Make sure any words that contain special characters are escaped and include word boundaries as per the Regex examples below.

# Example the User-Agent name "someverybaduseragentname1" is entered as "\bsomeverybaduseragentname1\b"
# Example the User-Agent name "some-very-bad-useragentname2" is entered as "\bsome\-very\-bad\-useragentname1\b" 
# the "\b" are word boundaries which prevents partial matching and false positives.

# BY DEFAULT ALL THE EXAMPLES BELOW ARE COMMENTED OUT AND HENCE NOT ENABLED

# ---------------------	
# WHITELISTING EXAMPLES
# ---------------------
#	"~*\bsomeverygooduseragentname1\b"			0;
#	"~*\bsomeverygooduseragentname2\b"			0;
#	"~*\bsome\-very\-good\-useragentname2\b"	0;

# ---------------------
# BLACKLISTING EXAMPLES
# ---------------------
#	"~*\bsomeverybaduseragentname1\b"			3;
#	"~*\bsomeverybaduseragentname2\b"			3;
#	"~*\bsome\-very\-bad\-useragentname2\b"		3;

# START MAKE BAD BOTS GOOD ### DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE AT ALL ###
	"~*(?:\b)GoogleBot(?:\b|)"		2;
# END MAKE BAD BOTS GOOD ### DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE AT ALL ###
