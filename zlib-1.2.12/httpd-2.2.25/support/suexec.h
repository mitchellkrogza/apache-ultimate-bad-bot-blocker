 *                   be allowed.  All executables under this directory
 *                   will be executable by suEXEC as the user so 
 *                   they should be "safe" programs.  If you are 
 *                   using a "simple" UserDir directive (ie. one 
 *                   without a "*" in it) this should be set to 
 *                   the same value.  suEXEC will not work properly
 *                   in cases where the UserDir directive points to 
 *                   a location that is not the same as the user's
 *                   home directory as referenced in the passwd file.
 *
 *                   If you have VirtualHosts with a different
 *                   UserDir for each, you will need to define them to
 *                   all reside in one parent directory; then name that
 *                   parent directory here.  IF THIS IS NOT DEFINED
 *                   PROPERLY, ~USERDIR CGI REQUESTS WILL NOT WORK!
 *                   See the suEXEC documentation for more detailed
 *                   information.
