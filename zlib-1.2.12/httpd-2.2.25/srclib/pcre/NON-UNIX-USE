Compiling PCRE on non-Unix systems
----------------------------------

See below for comments on Cygwin or MinGW and OpenVMS usage. I (Philip Hazel)
have no knowledge of Windows or VMS sytems and how their libraries work. The
items in the PCRE Makefile that relate to anything other than Unix-like systems
have been contributed by PCRE users. There are some other comments and files in
the Contrib directory on the ftp site that you may find useful. See

  ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/Contrib

If you want to compile PCRE for a non-Unix system (or perhaps, more strictly,
for a system that does not support "configure" and "make" files), note that
PCRE consists entirely of code written in Standard C, and so should compile
successfully on any system that has a Standard C compiler and library.


GENERIC INSTRUCTIONS

The following are generic comments about building PCRE. The interspersed
indented commands are suggestions from Mark Tetrode as to which commands you
might use on a Windows system to build a static library.

(1) Copy or rename the file config.in as config.h, and change the macros that
define HAVE_STRERROR and HAVE_MEMMOVE to define them as 1 rather than 0.
Unfortunately, because of the way Unix autoconf works, the default setting has
to be 0. You may also want to make changes to other macros in config.h. In
particular, if you want to force a specific value for newline, you can define
the NEWLINE macro. The default is to use '\n', thereby using whatever value
your compiler gives to '\n'.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands
  copy config.in config.h
  rem Use write, because notepad cannot handle UNIX files. Change values.
  write config.h

(2) Copy or rename the file pcre.in as pcre.h, and change the macro definitions
for PCRE_MAJOR, PCRE_MINOR, and PCRE_DATE near its start to the values set in
configure.in.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands
  copy pcre.in pcre.h
  rem Read values from configure.in
  write configure.in
  rem Change values
  write pcre.h

(3) Compile dftables.c as a stand-alone program, and then run it with
the single argument "chartables.c". This generates a set of standard
character tables and writes them to that file.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands
  rem Compile & run
  cl -DSUPPORT_UTF8 dftables.c
  dftables.exe > chartables.c

(4) Compile maketables.c, get.c, study.c and pcre.c and link them all
together into an object library in whichever form your system keeps such
libraries. This is the pcre library (chartables.c is included by means of an
#include directive). If your system has static and shared libraries, you may
have to do this once for each type.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands, for a static library
  rem Compile & lib
  cl -DSUPPORT_UTF8 -DPOSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD=10 /c maketables.c get.c study.c pcre.c
  lib /OUT:pcre.lib maketables.obj get.obj study.obj pcre.obj

(5) Similarly, compile pcreposix.c and link it (on its own) as the pcreposix
library.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands, for a static library
  rem Compile & lib
  cl -DSUPPORT_UTF8 -DPOSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD=10 /c pcreposix.c
  lib /OUT:pcreposix.lib pcreposix.obj

(6) Compile the test program pcretest.c. This needs the functions in the
pcre and pcreposix libraries when linking.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands
  rem compile & link
  cl pcretest.c pcre.lib pcreposix.lib

(7) Run pcretest on the testinput files in the testdata directory, and check
that the output matches the corresponding testoutput files. You must use the
-i option when checking testinput2. Note that the supplied files are in Unix
format, with just LF characters as line terminators. You may need to edit them
to change this if your system uses a different convention.

  rem Mark Tetrode's commands
  rem Make a change, i.e. space, backspace, and save again - do this for all
  rem to change UNIX to Win, \n to \n\r
  write testoutput1
  write testoutput2
  write testoutput3
  write testoutput4
  write testoutput5
  pcretest testdata\testinput1 testdata\myoutput1
  windiff testdata\testoutput1 testdata\myoutput1
  pcretest -i testdata\testinput2 testdata\myoutput2
  windiff testdata\testoutput2 testdata\myoutput2
  pcretest testdata\testinput3 testdata\myoutput3
  windiff testdata\testoutput3 testdata\myoutput3
  pcretest testdata\testinput4 testdata\myoutput4
  windiff testdata\testoutput4 testdata\myoutput4
  pcretest testdata\testinput5 testdata\myoutput5
  windiff testdata\testoutput5 testdata\myoutput5


FURTHER REMARKS

If you have a system without "configure" but where you can use a Makefile, edit
Makefile.in to create Makefile, substituting suitable values for the variables
at the head of the file.

Some help in building a Win32 DLL of PCRE in GnuWin32 environments was
contributed by Paul Sokolovsky. These environments are Mingw32
(http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/) and CygWin
(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/). Paul comments:

  For CygWin, set CFLAGS=-mno-cygwin, and do 'make dll'. You'll get
  pcre.dll (containing pcreposix also), libpcre.dll.a, and dynamically
  linked pgrep and pcretest. If you have /bin/sh, run RunTest (three
  main test go ok, locale not supported).

Changes to do MinGW with autoconf 2.50 were supplied by Fred Cox
<sailorFred@yahoo.com>, who comments as follows:

  If you are using the PCRE DLL, the normal Unix style configure && make &&
  make check && make install should just work[*]. If you want to statically
  link against the .a file, you must define PCRE_STATIC before including
  pcre.h, otherwise the pcre_malloc and pcre_free exported functions will be
  declared __declspec(dllimport), with hilarious results.  See the configure.in
  and pcretest.c for how it is done for the static test.

  Also, there will only be a libpcre.la, not a libpcreposix.la, as you
  would expect from the Unix version. The single DLL includes the pcreposix
  interface.

[*] But note that the supplied test files are in Unix format, with just LF
characters as line terminators. You will have to edit them to change to CR LF
terminators.

A script for building PCRE using Borland's C++ compiler for use with VPASCAL
was contributed by Alexander Tokarev. It is called makevp.bat.

These are some further comments about Win32 builds from Mark Evans. They
were contributed before Fred Cox's changes were made, so it is possible that
they may no longer be relevant.

"The documentation for Win32 builds is a bit shy.  Under MSVC6 I
followed their instructions to the letter, but there were still
some things missing.

(1) Must #define STATIC for entire project if linking statically.
    (I see no reason to use DLLs for code this compact.)  This of
    course is a project setting in MSVC under Preprocessor.

(2) Missing some #ifdefs relating to the function pointers
    pcre_malloc and pcre_free.  See my solution below.  (The stubs
    may not be mandatory but they made me feel better.)"

=========================
#ifdef _WIN32
#include <malloc.h>

void* malloc_stub(size_t N)
{ return malloc(N); }
void free_stub(void* p)
{ free(p); }
void *(*pcre_malloc)(size_t) = &malloc_stub;
void  (*pcre_free)(void *) = &free_stub;

#else

void *(*pcre_malloc)(size_t) = malloc;
void  (*pcre_free)(void *) = free;

#endif

BUILDING PCRE ON OPENVMS

Dan Mooney sent the following comments about building PCRE on OpenVMS:

"It was quite easy to compile and link the library. I don't have a formal
make file but the attached file [reproduced below] contains the OpenVMS DCL
commands I used to build the library. I had to add #define
POSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD 10 to pcre.h since it was not defined anywhere.

The library was built on:
O/S: HP OpenVMS v7.3-1
Compiler: Compaq C v6.5-001-48BCD
Linker: vA13-01

The test results did not match 100% due to the issues you mention in your
documentation regarding isprint(), iscntrl(), isgraph() and ispunct(). I
modified some of the character tables temporarily and was able to get the
results to match. Tests using the fr locale did not match since I don't have
that locale loaded. The study size was always reported to be 3 less than the
value in the standard test output files."

=========================

$!   The test results did not match 100%. The functions isprint(), iscntrl(),
