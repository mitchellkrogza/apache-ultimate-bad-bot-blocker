with the Web, HTTP, and Apache, but are not security experts. It is not
intended to be a definitive guide to the SSL protocol, nor does it discuss
specific techniques for managing certificates in an organization, or the
important legal issues of patents and import and export restrictions.
Rather, it is intended to provide a common background to <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_ssl.html">mod_ssl</a></code> users by pulling together various concepts, definitions,

<h2><a name="cryptographictech" id="cryptographictech">Cryptographic Techniques</a></h2>

<p>Understanding SSL requires an understanding of cryptographic
algorithms, message digest functions (aka. one-way or hash functions), and
digital signatures. These techniques are the subject of entire books (see
for instance [<a href="#AC96">AC96</a>]) and provide the basis for privacy,
integrity, and authentication.</p>

<h3><a name="cryptographicalgo" id="cryptographicalgo">Cryptographic Algorithms</a></h3>

    <p>Suppose Alice wants to send a message to her bank to transfer some
    money. Alice would like the message to be private, since it will
    include information such as her account number and transfer amount. One
    solution is to use a cryptographic algorithm, a technique that would
    transform her message into an encrypted form, unreadable until it is
    decrypted. Once in this form, the message can only be
    decrypted by using a secret key. Without the key the message is useless: 
    good cryptographic algorithms make it so difficult
    for intruders to decode the original text that it isn't worth their
    effort.</p>

    <p>There are two categories of cryptographic algorithms: conventional
    and public key.</p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Conventional cryptography</dt>
    <dd>also known as symmetric cryptography, requires the sender and
    receiver to share a key: a secret piece of information that may be
    used to encrypt or decrypt a message. As long as this key is kept 
    secret, nobody other than the sender or recipient can read the message. 
    If Alice and the bank know a secret key, then they can send each other
    private messages. The task of sharing a key between sender and recipient
    before communicating, while also keeping it secret from others, can be 
    problematic.</dd>

    <dt>Public key cryptography</dt>
    <dd>also known as asymmetric cryptography, solves the key exchange
    problem by defining an algorithm which uses two keys, each of which
    may be used to encrypt a message. If one key is used to encrypt a
    message then the other must be used to decrypt it. This makes it
    possible to receive secure messages by simply publishing one key
    (the public key) and keeping the other secret (the private key).</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Anyone can encrypt a message using the public key, but only the
    owner of the private key will be able to read it. In this way, Alice
    can send private messages to the owner of a key-pair (the bank), by
    encrypting them using their public key. Only the bank will be able to
    decrypt them.</p>


<h3><a name="messagedigests" id="messagedigests">Message Digests</a></h3>

    <p>Although Alice may encrypt her message to make it private, there
    is still a concern that someone might modify her original message or
    substitute it with a different one, in order to transfer the money
    to themselves, for instance. One way of guaranteeing the integrity
    of Alice's message is for her to create a concise summary of her 
    message and send this to the bank as well. Upon receipt of the message, 
    the bank creates its own summary and compares it with the one Alice 
    sent. If the summaries are the same then the message has been received
    intact.</p>

    <p>A summary such as this is called a <dfn>message digest</dfn>, <em>one-way
    function</em> or <em>hash function</em>. Message digests are used to create
    a short, fixed-length representation of a longer, variable-length message.
    Digest algorithms are designed to produce a unique digest for each
    message. Message digests are designed to make it impractically difficult 
    to determine the message from the digest and (in theory) impossible to 
    find two different messages which create the same digest -- thus 
    eliminating the possibility of substituting one message for another while 
    maintaining the same digest.</p>

    <p>Another challenge that Alice faces is finding a way to send the digest
    to the bank securely; if the digest is not sent securely, its integrity may
    be compromised and with it the possibility for the bank to determine the
    integrity of the original message. Only if the digest is sent securely can
    the integrity of the associated message be determined.</p>
    
    <p>One way to send the digest securely is to include it in a digital 
    signature.</p>


<h3><a name="digitalsignatures" id="digitalsignatures">Digital Signatures</a></h3>
<p>When Alice sends a message to the bank, the bank needs to ensure that the
message is really from her, so an intruder cannot request a transaction
involving her account. A <em>digital signature</em>, created by Alice and
included with the message, serves this purpose.</p>

<p>Digital signatures are created by encrypting a digest of the message and
other information (such as a sequence number) with the sender's private key.
Though anyone can <em>decrypt</em> the signature using the public key, only the
sender knows the private key. This means that only the sender can have signed
the message. Including the digest in the signature means the signature is only
good for that message; it also ensures the integrity of the message since no one
can change the digest and still sign it.</p>
<p>To guard against interception and reuse of the signature by an intruder at a
later date, the signature contains a unique sequence number. This protects
the bank from a fraudulent claim from Alice that she did not send the message
-- only she could have signed it (non-repudiation).</p>

</div><div class="top"><a href="#page-header"><img alt="top" src="../images/up.gif" /></a></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="certificates" id="certificates">Certificates</a></h2>

<p>Although Alice could have sent a private message to the bank, signed
it and ensured the integrity of the message, she still needs to be sure
that she is really communicating with the bank. This means that she needs
to be sure that the public key she is using is part of the bank's key-pair, 
and not an intruder's. Similarly, the bank needs to verify that the message
signature really was signed by the private key that belongs to Alice.</p>

<p>If each party has a certificate which validates the other's identity,
confirms the public key and is signed by a trusted agency, then both
can be assured that they are communicating with whom they think they are.
Such a trusted agency is called a <em>Certificate Authority</em> and
certificates are used for authentication.</p>

<h3><a name="certificatecontents" id="certificatecontents">Certificate Contents</a></h3>

    <p>A certificate associates a public key with the real identity of
    an individual, server, or other entity, known as the subject. As
    shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, information about the subject
    includes identifying information (the distinguished name) and the
    public key. It also includes the identification and signature of the
    Certificate Authority that issued the certificate and the period of
    time during which the certificate is valid. It may have additional
    information (or extensions) as well as administrative information
    for the Certificate Authority's use, such as a serial number.</p>

    <h4><a name="table1" id="table1">Table 1: Certificate Information</a></h4>
    
    <table>
    
    <tr><th>Subject</th>
        <td>Distinguished Name, Public Key</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Issuer</th>
        <td>Distinguished Name, Signature</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Period of Validity</th>
        <td>Not Before Date, Not After Date</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Administrative Information</th>
        <td>Version, Serial Number</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Extended Information</th>
        <td>Basic Constraints, Netscape Flags, etc.</td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>A distinguished name is used to provide an identity in a specific
    context -- for instance, an individual might have a personal
    certificate as well as one for their identity as an employee.
    Distinguished names are defined by the X.509 standard [<a href="#X509">X509</a>], which defines the fields, field names and
    abbreviations used to refer to the fields (see <a href="#table2">Table
    2</a>).</p>

    <h4><a name="table2" id="table2">Table 2: Distinguished Name Information</a></h4>
    
    <table class="bordered">
    
    <tr><th>DN Field</th>
        <th>Abbrev.</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Common Name</td>
        <td>CN</td>
        <td>Name being certified</td>
        <td>CN=Joe Average</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Organization or Company</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>Name is associated with this<br />organization</td>
        <td>O=Snake Oil, Ltd.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Organizational Unit</td>
        <td>OU</td>
        <td>Name is associated with this <br />organization unit, such
        as a department</td>
        <td>OU=Research Institute</td></tr>
    <tr><td>City/Locality</td>
        <td>L</td>
        <td>Name is located in this City</td>
        <td>L=Snake City</td></tr>
    <tr><td>State/Province</td>
        <td>ST</td>
        <td>Name is located in this State/Province</td>
        <td>ST=Desert</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Country</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>Name is located in this Country (ISO code)</td>
        <td>C=XZ</td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>A Certificate Authority may define a policy specifying which
    distinguished field names are optional and which are required. It
    may also place requirements upon the field contents, as may users of
    certificates. For example, a Netscape browser requires that the
    Common Name for a certificate representing a server matches a wildcard 
    pattern for the domain name of that server, such
    as <code>*.snakeoil.com</code>.</p>

    <p>The binary format of a certificate is defined using the ASN.1
    notation [<a href="#X208">X208</a>] [<a href="#PKCS">PKCS</a>]. This
    notation defines how to specify the contents and encoding rules
    define how this information is translated into binary form. The binary
    encoding of the certificate is defined using Distinguished Encoding
    Rules (DER), which are based on the more general Basic Encoding Rules
    (BER). For those transmissions which cannot handle binary, the binary
    form may be translated into an ASCII form by using Base64 encoding
    [<a href="#MIME">MIME</a>]. When placed between begin and end delimiter
    lines (as below), this encoded version is called a PEM ("Privacy Enhanced
    Mail") encoded certificate.</p>

<h3><a name="certificateauthorities" id="certificateauthorities">Certificate Authorities</a></h3>

    <p>By verifying the information in a certificate request
    before granting the certificate, the Certificate Authority assures
    itself of the identity of the private key owner of a key-pair. 
    For instance, if Alice requests a personal certificate, the 
    Certificate Authority must first make sure that Alice really is the 
    person the certificate request claims she is.</p>

    <h4><a name="certificatechains" id="certificatechains">Certificate Chains</a></h4>
    
        <p>A Certificate Authority may also issue a certificate for
        another Certificate Authority. When examining a certificate,
        Alice may need to examine the certificate of the issuer, for each
        parent Certificate Authority, until reaching one which she has
        confidence in. She may decide to trust only certificates with a
        limited chain of issuers, to reduce her risk of a "bad" certificate
        in the chain.</p>
    

    <h4><a name="rootlevelca" id="rootlevelca">Creating a Root-Level CA</a></h4>
    
        <p>As noted earlier, each certificate requires an issuer to assert
        the validity of the identity of the certificate subject, up to
        the top-level Certificate Authority (CA). This presents a problem:
        who can vouch for the certificate of the top-level
        authority, which has no issuer? In this unique case, the
        certificate is "self-signed", so the issuer of the certificate is
        the same as the subject. Browsers are preconfigured to trust well-known
        certificate authorities, but it is important to exercise extra care in
        trusting a self-signed certificate. The wide publication of a
        public key by the root authority reduces the risk in trusting this
        key -- it would be obvious if someone else publicized a key
        claiming to be the authority.</p>

        <p>A number of companies, such as <a href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a> and <a href="http://www.verisign.com/">VeriSign</a>
        have established themselves as Certificate Authorities. These
        companies provide the following services:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Verifying certificate requests</li>
        <li>Processing certificate requests</li>
        <li>Issuing and managing certificates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is also possible to create your own Certificate Authority.
        Although risky in the Internet environment, it may be useful
        within an Intranet where the organization can easily verify the
        identities of individuals and servers.</p>
    

    <h4><a name="certificatemanagement" id="certificatemanagement">Certificate Management</a></h4>
    
        <p>Establishing a Certificate Authority is a responsibility which
        requires a solid administrative, technical and management
        framework. Certificate Authorities not only issue certificates,
        they also manage them -- that is, they determine for how long
        certificates remain valid, they renew them and keep lists of
        certificates that were issued in the past but are no longer valid
	    (Certificate Revocation Lists, or CRLs).</p> 

        <p>For example, if Alice is entitled to a certificate as an 
        employee of a company but has now left
        that company, her certificate may need to be revoked.
        Because certificates are only issued after the subject's identity has
        been verified and can then be passed around to all those with whom 
        the subject may communicate, it is impossible to tell from the 
        certificate alone that it has been revoked. 
        Therefore when examining certificates for validity 
        it is necessary to contact the issuing Certificate Authority to 
        check CRLs -- this is usually not an automated part of the process.</p>

        <div class="note"><h3>Note</h3>
        <p>If you use a Certificate Authority that browsers are not configured
        to trust by default, it is necessary to load the Certificate
        Authority certificate into the browser, enabling the browser to
        validate server certificates signed by that Certificate Authority.
        Doing so may be dangerous, since once loaded, the browser will
        accept all certificates signed by that Certificate Authority.</p>

<h2><a name="ssl" id="ssl">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a></h2>

<p>The Secure Sockets Layer protocol is a protocol layer which may be
placed between a reliable connection-oriented network layer protocol
(e.g. TCP/IP) and the application protocol layer (e.g. HTTP). SSL provides
for secure communication between client and server by allowing mutual
authentication, the use of digital signatures for integrity and encryption
for privacy.</p>

<p>The protocol is designed to support a range of choices for specific
algorithms used for cryptography, digests and signatures. This allows
algorithm selection for specific servers to be made based on legal, export
or other concerns and also enables the protocol to take advantage of new
algorithms. Choices are negotiated between client and server when
establishing a protocol session.</p>

    </table>


<p>There are a number of versions of the SSL protocol, as shown in 
<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. As noted there, one of the benefits in
SSL 3.0 is that it adds support of certificate chain loading. This feature
allows a server to pass a server certificate along with issuer certificates
to the browser. Chain loading also permits the browser to validate the
server certificate, even if Certificate Authority certificates are not
installed for the intermediate issuers, since they are included in the
certificate chain. SSL 3.0 is the basis for the Transport Layer Security 
[<a href="#TLS1">TLS</a>] protocol standard, currently in development by
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>

<h3><a name="session" id="session">Establishing a Session</a></h3>

    <p>The SSL session is established by following a handshake sequence
    between client and server, as shown in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>. This sequence may vary, depending on whether the server
    is configured to provide a server certificate or request a client
    certificate. Although cases exist where additional handshake steps
    are required for management of cipher information, this article
    summarizes one common scenario. See the SSL specification for the full
    range of possibilities.</p>

    <div class="note"><h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Once an SSL session has been established, it may be reused. This
    avoids the performance penalty of repeating the many steps needed
    to start a session. To do this, the server assigns each SSL session a
    unique session identifier which is cached in the server and which the
    client can use in future connections to reduce the handshake time
    (until the session identifer expires from the cache of the server).</p>
    </div>

    <img src="../images/ssl_intro_fig1.gif" alt="" width="423" height="327" /><br />
    <a id="figure1" name="figure1"><dfn>Figure 1</dfn></a>: Simplified SSL
    Handshake Sequence</p>

    <p>The elements of the handshake sequence, as used by the client and
    server, are listed below:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Negotiate the Cipher Suite to be used during data transfer</li>
    <li>Establish and share a session key between client and server</li>
    <li>Optionally authenticate the server to the client</li>
    <li>Optionally authenticate the client to the server</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first step, Cipher Suite Negotiation, allows the client and
    server to choose a Cipher Suite supported by both of them. The SSL3.0
    protocol specification defines 31 Cipher Suites. A Cipher Suite is
    defined by the following components:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Key Exchange Method</li>
    <li>Cipher for Data Transfer</li>
    <li>Message Digest for creating the Message Authentication Code (MAC)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These three elements are described in the sections that follow.</p>


<h3><a name="keyexchange" id="keyexchange">Key Exchange Method</a></h3>

    <p>The key exchange method defines how the shared secret symmetric
    cryptography key used for application data transfer will be agreed
    upon by client and server. SSL 2.0 uses RSA key exchange only, while
    SSL 3.0 supports a choice of key exchange algorithms including
    RSA key exchange (when certificates are used), and Diffie-Hellman key
    exchange (for exchanging keys without certificates, or without prior
    communication between client and server).</p>

    <p>One variable in the choice of key exchange methods is digital
    signatures -- whether or not to use them, and if so, what kind of
    signatures to use. Signing with a private key provides protection 
    against a man-in-the-middle-attack during the information exchange
    used to generating the shared key [<a href="#AC96">AC96</a>, p516].</p>


<h3><a name="ciphertransfer" id="ciphertransfer">Cipher for Data Transfer</a></h3>

    <p>SSL uses conventional symmetric cryptography, as described earlier, 
    for encrypting messages in a session.
    There are nine choices of how to encrypt, including the option not to
    encrypt:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>No encryption</li>
    <li>Stream Ciphers
        <ul>
        <li>RC4 with 40-bit keys</li>
        <li>RC4 with 128-bit keys</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>CBC Block Ciphers
        <ul><li>RC2 with 40 bit key</li>
        <li>DES with 40 bit key</li>
        <li>DES with 56 bit key</li>
        <li>Triple-DES with 168 bit key</li>
        <li>Idea (128 bit key)</li>
        <li>Fortezza (96 bit key)</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p>"CBC" refers to Cipher Block Chaining, which means that a
    portion of the previously encrypted cipher text is used in the
    encryption of the current block. "DES" refers to the Data Encryption
    Standard [<a href="#AC96">AC96</a>, ch12], which has a number of
    variants (including DES40 and 3DES_EDE). "Idea" is currently one of 
    the best and cryptographically strongest algorithms available, 
    and "RC2" is a proprietary algorithm from RSA DSI [<a href="#AC96">AC96</a>, ch13].</p>


<h3><a name="digestfuntion" id="digestfuntion">Digest Function</a></h3>

    <p>The choice of digest function determines how a digest is created
    from a record unit. SSL supports the following:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>No digest (Null choice)</li>
    <li>MD5, a 128-bit hash</li>
    <li>Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1), a 160-bit hash</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The message digest is used to create a Message Authentication Code
    (MAC) which is encrypted with the message to verify integrity and to
    protect against replay attacks.</p>


<h3><a name="handshake" id="handshake">Handshake Sequence Protocol</a></h3>

    <p>The handshake sequence uses three protocols:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The <dfn>SSL Handshake Protocol</dfn>
    for performing the client and server SSL session establishment.</li>
    <li>The <dfn>SSL Change Cipher Spec Protocol</dfn> for actually
    establishing agreement on the Cipher Suite for the session.</li>
    <li>The <dfn>SSL Alert Protocol</dfn> for conveying SSL error
    messages between client and server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These protocols, as well as application protocol data, are
    encapsulated in the <dfn>SSL Record Protocol</dfn>, as shown in
    <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>. An encapsulated protocol is
    transferred as data by the lower layer protocol, which does not
    examine the data. The encapsulated protocol has no knowledge of the
    underlying protocol.</p>

    <p class="figure">
    <img src="../images/ssl_intro_fig2.gif" alt="" width="428" height="217" /><br />
    <a id="figure2" name="figure2"><dfn>Figure 2</dfn></a>: SSL Protocol Stack
    </p>

    <p>The encapsulation of SSL control protocols by the record protocol
    means that if an active session is renegotiated the control protocols
    will be transmitted securely. If there was no previous session,    
    the Null cipher suite is used, which means there will be no encryption and
    messages will have no integrity digests, until the session has been
    established.</p>


<h3><a name="datatransfer" id="datatransfer">Data Transfer</a></h3>

    <p>The SSL Record Protocol, shown in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>,
    is used to transfer application and SSL Control data between the
    client and server, where necessary fragmenting this data into smaller units,
    or combining multiple higher level protocol data messages into single
    units. It may compress, attach digest signatures, and encrypt these
    units before transmitting them using the underlying reliable transport
    protocol (Note: currently, no major SSL implementations include support
    for compression).</p>

    <p class="figure">
    <img src="../images/ssl_intro_fig3.gif" alt="" width="423" height="323" /><br />
    <a id="figure3" name="figure3"><dfn>Figure 3</dfn></a>: SSL Record Protocol
    </p>


<h3><a name="securehttp" id="securehttp">Securing HTTP Communication</a></h3>

    <p>One common use of SSL is to secure Web HTTP communication between
    a browser and a webserver. This does not preclude the use of
    non-secured HTTP - the secure version (called HTTPS) is the same as 
    plain HTTP over SSL, but uses the URL scheme <code>https</code> 
    rather than <code>http</code>, and a different server port (by default,
    port 443). This functionality is a large part of what <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_ssl.html">mod_ssl</a></code> provides for the Apache webserver.</p>
