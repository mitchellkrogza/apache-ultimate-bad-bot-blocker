htcacheclean \- Clean up the disk cache

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
htcacheclean is used to keep the size of mod_disk_cache's storage within a certain limit\&. This tool can run either manually or in daemon mode\&. When running in daemon mode, it sleeps in the background and checks the cache directories at regular intervals for cached content to be removed\&. You can stop the daemon cleanly by sending it a TERM or INT signal\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
-d\fIinterval\fR
Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every \fIinterval\fR minutes\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the -D, -v and -r options\&. To shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it a SIGTERM or SIGINT\&.  
.TP
-D
Do a dry run and don't delete anything\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the -d option\&.  
.TP
-v
Be verbose and print statistics\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the -d option\&.  
.TP
-r
Clean thoroughly\&. This assumes that the Apache web server is not running (otherwise you may get garbage in the cache)\&. This option is mutually exclusive with the -d option and implies the -t option\&.  
.TP
-n
Be nice\&. This causes slower processing in favour of other processes\&. htcacheclean will sleep from time to time so that (a) the disk IO will be delayed and (b) the kernel can schedule other processes in the meantime\&.  
.TP
-t
Delete all empty directories\&. By default only cache files are removed, however with some configurations the large number of directories created may require attention\&. If your configuration requires a very large number of directories, to the point that inode or file allocation table exhaustion may become an issue, use of this option is advised\&.  
.TP
-p\fIpath\fR
Specify \fIpath\fR as the root directory of the disk cache\&. This should be the same value as specified with the CacheRoot directive\&.  
.TP
-l\fIlimit\fR
Specify \fIlimit\fR as the total disk cache size limit\&. The value is expressed in bytes by default (or attaching B to the number)\&. Attach K for Kbytes or M for MBytes\&.  
.TP
-i
Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of the disk cache\&. This option is only possible together with the -d option\&.  
 
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
 
.PP
htcacheclean returns a zero status ("true") if all operations were successful, 1 otherwise\&.
