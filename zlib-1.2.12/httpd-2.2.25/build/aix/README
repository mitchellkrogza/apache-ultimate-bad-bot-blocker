The script buildaix.ksh will attempt to build a AIX installp fileset
out of a source tree for ASF project

REQUIREMENTS:
  Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  bos.adt.insttools          5.3.7.2    C     F    Tool to Create installp
                                                   Packages
  Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  rpm.rte                   3.0.5.41    C     F    RPM Package Manager

Additional:
Preferred: download zlib sources and copy zlib.h and zconf.h to /opt/include
and, if configure cannot find them directly, add symbolic links from /usr/include to /opt/include

To build a package, make sure you are in the root of the source tree,
and run:

build/aix/buildaix.ksh

An AIX fileset named $PKG.$NAME.$ARCH.$VERSION.I will be
created in the build/aix directory. the .template file created is also there.

KNOWN issues:
on AIX libtool is known to have issues with the install command.
Some of these issues have been resolved by extracting the apr/apu utilities
from the projects (i.e. NOT using the embedded version)
In case of problems I recommend that you install the GNU 'install' program (part of coreutils)
If make DESTDIR=$TEMPDIR install command continues to fail, try 'make install' and then run
the buildaix.ksh command again

TODO
Add Copyright display/banner
Add Apache LICENSE to fileset and require acceptance
Add special instructions for TCB - to ignore /etc/* /var/httpd/htdocs/*
Add _config_i scripts to setup autostart
Add _pre_i scripts to verify pre-requisites, required users/groups, etc.
