**COPY THE GLOBALBLACKLIST.CONF FILE FROM THE REPO**
$APACHE_CONF is generally located at /etc/apache2 or /etc/httpd depending on OS

Copy the contents of **globalblacklist.conf** into your $APACHE_CONF/custom.d folder. 
e.g. /etc/apache2/custom.d on Ubuntu/Debian
     /etc/httpd on RHEL/centos
**You need to create this folder.**

The following directions use /etc/apache2 as an example.

`sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/custom.d`

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf`

If your Linux distribution does not have wget you can replace the wget commands using curl as follows:

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -o /etc/apache2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf`

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-2.png"/>

**WHITELIST ALL YOUR OWN DOMAIN NAMES AND IP ADDRESSES**

Whitelist all your own domain names and IP addresses. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you do not have to keep reinserting your whitelisted domains and IP addresses every time you update.

:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: WARNING: Please do NOT ever use 127.0.0.1 as a whitelisted IP address in whitelist-ips.conf it will cause the blocker to stop functioning.

- copy the whitelist-ips.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/whitelist-ips.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/whitelist-ips.conf`


- copy the whitelist-domains.conf file into the same folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/whitelist-domains.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/whitelist-domains.conf`

Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit both whitelist-ips.conf and whitelist-domains.conf to include all your own domain names and IP addresses that you want to specifically whitelist from the blocker script.

To automatically add all currently configured domains to the whitelist run

`sudo apache2ctl -S | grep -o -E 'alias (.*)|(namevhost|server) (.*)\s' | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | grep -v '*' | sed -E 's/([.\-])/\\\1/g' | sed -E 's/(.+)/SetEnvIfNoCase Referer ~*\1 good_ref/g' | sort | uniq | sudo tee -a /etc/apache2/custom.d/whitelist-domains.conf`

When pulling any future updates now you can simply pull the latest globalblacklist.conf file and it will automatically include your whitelisted domains and IP addresses. No more remembering having to do this yourself.

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BLACKLIST INCLUDE FILE FOR IP ADDRESS AND IP RANGE BLOCKING**

Blacklist any IP addresses or Ranges you wish to keep out of your servers. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you have full control over what IP addresses and IP Ranges and blocked from your Apache Server.

- copy the blacklist-ips.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/blacklist-ips.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/blacklist-ips.conf`


Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit the blacklist-ips.conf file as you like. 

When pulling any future updates now your custom IP blacklist will not be overwritten.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-4.png"/>

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BAD REFERRER WORDS INCLUDE FILE FOR CUSTOMIZED SCANNING OF BAD WORDS**

Scan for any bad referrer words you wish to keep out of your servers. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you have full control over what IP addresses and IP Ranges and blocked from your Apache Server.

- copy the bad-referrer-words.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/bad-referrer-words.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/bad-referrer-words.conf`


Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit the bad-referrer-words.conf file as you like. 

When pulling any future updates now your custom bad referrer words list will not be overwritten.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-5.png"/>

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BLACKLIST USER-AGENTS INCLUDE FILE FOR CUSTOMIZED BLOCKING OF USER AGENTS**

Allows you to add your own custom list of user agents with this new include file.

- copy the blacklist-user-agents.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf`

**NOTE:** On the Apache Blocker if you want to over-ride any of the whitelisted bots you can add them to this include file and the previously whitelisted bots in the blocker will be over-ridden by this include file. So let's say for some "obscure" reason you really do not want any search engines like Googlebot or Bingbot to ever access or index your site, you add them to your blacklist-user-agents.conf and they will be over-ridden from the earlier whitelisting in the blocker. This now gives users total control over the blocker without every having to try and modify the globalblacklist.conf file. So now you can customize all your include files and you can still pull the daily updates of globalblacklist.conf and it will not touch any of your custom include files.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-6.png"/>

**INCLUDE THE GLOBALBLACKLIST.CONF**

Include the globalblacklist.conf file in the beginning of a directory block just after your opening Options statements and before the rest of your host config example below. **Remove the "<<<<<< This needs to be added" part**

```
<VirtualHost *:80>

	ServerName local.dev
    ServerAlias www.local.dev
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

		<Directory "/var/www/html">
    		AllowOverride All
    		Options FollowSymLinks
			Include custom.d/globalblacklist.conf
  		</Directory>

</VirtualHost>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
```

You can include globalblacklist.conf globally (for all virtual hosts) if you put the following configuration after virtual host configuration.

```
# ######################################
# GLOBAL! deny bad bots and IP addresses
# ######################################
#
# should be set after <VirtualHost>s see https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/sections.html#merging
<Location "/">
	# AND-combine with preceding configuration sections  
	AuthMerging And
	# include black list
	Include custom.d/globalblacklist.conf
</Location>
```

**TEST YOUR APACHE CONFIGURATION**

Do an Apache2 Config Test

`sudo apache2ctl configtest`

If you get no errors then you followed my instructions so now you can make the blocker go live with a simple.

`sudo service apache2 reload`

or

`sudo service httpd reload`

The blocker is now active and working so now you can run some simple tests from another linux machine to make sure it's working.

************************************************
<img src="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-8.png"/>

*TESTING**

Run the following commands one by one from a terminal on another linux machine against your own domain name. 
**substitute yourdomain.com in the examples below with your REAL domain name**

`curl -A "googlebot" http://yourdomain.com`

Should respond with 200 OK

`curl -A "80legs" http://yourdomain.com`

`curl -A "masscan" http://yourdomain.com`

Should respond with 403 Forbidden

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://100dollars-seo.com`

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://zx6.ru`

Should respond with 403 Forbidden

The Apache Ultimate Bot Blocker is now WORKING and PROTECTING your web sites !!!

**UPDATING THE APACHE BAD BOT BLOCKER** is now easy thanks to the automatic includes for whitelisting your own domain names.

Updating to the latest version is now as simple as:

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.4/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf`

`sudo apache2ctl configtest`

`sudo service apache2 reload` 

And you will be up to date with all your whitelisted domains included automatically for you now.

## HOW TO MONITOR YOUR APACHE LOGS DAILY (The Easy Way):

With great thanks and appreciation to https://blog.nexcess.net/2011/01/21/one-liners-for-apache-log-files/

To monitor your top referer's for a web site's log file's on a daily basis use the following simple
cron jobs which will email you a list of top referer's / user agents every morning from a particular web site's log
files. This is an example for just one cron job for one site. Set up multiple one's for each one you
want to monitor. Here is a cron that runs at 8am every morning and emails me the stripped down log of
referers. When I say stripped down, the domain of the site and other referers like Google and Bing are
stripped from the results. Of course you must change the log file name, domain name and your email address in
the examples below. The second cron for collecting User agents does not do any stripping out of any referers but you
can add that functionality if you like copying the awk statement !~ from the first example.

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily Referers on Apache

`00 08 * * * tail -10000 /var/log/apache/mydomain-access.log | awk '$11 !~ /google|bing|yahoo|yandex|mywebsite.com/' | awk '{print $11}' | tr -d '"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s "Top 1000 Referers for Mydomain.com" me@mydomain.com`

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily User Agents on Apache

`00 08 * * * tail -50000 /var/log/apache/mydomain-access.log | awk '{print $12}' | tr -d '"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s "Top 1000 Agents for Mydomain.com" me@mydomain.com`
